## What Is Machine Learning?
- **Definition**: Machine learning (ML) is the science of getting computers to learn from data **without being explicitly programmed**.
- **Origins**:
  - ML grew out of **artificial intelligence (AI)**, whose goal is to build intelligent machines.
- **Why ML is needed**:
  - Some tasks can be explicitly programmed:
    - Shortest path from A to B (e.g., GPS routing)
  - Many important tasks **cannot** be written as fixed rules:
    - Web search ranking
    - Speech recognition
    - Medical diagnosis from X-rays
    - Self-driving cars
  - For these problems, the only known solution is to let machines **learn patterns from data**.
- **Long-term goal**:
  - Build machines as intelligent as humans (**Artificial General Intelligence, AGI**).

### Everyday Applications of ML
- **Web search ranking** (Google, Bing, Baidu)
  - Learns how to rank web pages by relevance
- **Photo tagging / face recognition** (Instagram, Snapchat)
  - Identifies and labels people in photos
- **Recommendation systems**
  - Suggests content based on past behavior (e.g., movies, music)
- **Speech recognition / voice assistants**
  - Voice-to-text for messages
  - Voice commands (e.g., “Hey Siri”, “OK Google”)
- **Spam filtering**
  - Flags scam or unwanted emails as spam
